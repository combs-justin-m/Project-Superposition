### Technologies

- AngularJS
- Firebase

### Usage

- `git clone` repo URL
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

This template contains some simple `gulp` tasks. They are as follows:


- `gulp watch`: This will launch a Node Server and start the standard `watchlist` task
- `gulp bower`: This will move the bower components into their proper location. This will run during the `watch` task, but you may need to run it manually once in a while

There are many more tasks, and you really should read through the `gulpfile.js`, but the ones above will take care of you in most cases.
